This repository demonstrates a common SQL error involving the misuse of aggregate functions (like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) within subqueries or WHERE clauses. The `bug.sql` file shows the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version.  The problem arises from applying aggregate functions without proper grouping, leading to inaccurate results. The README explains the issue and its solution in detail.
